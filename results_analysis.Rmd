Look at what the spread is between how much carbon is stored in products vs in the stand

```{r, echo = FALSE}
## cum_discount_decay = chips
## cum_discount_carb = discounted total stand carbon
## cum_discount_merch = cummulative discounted merchantable

portions <- simple_acre %>% 
  select(ID, rxpackage, county, acres, 
         cum_discount_carb, cum_discount_merch,
         total_discount_carb) %>% 
  mutate(ratio_stand_carb = cum_discount_carb/total_discount_carb) %>% 
  mutate(ratio_merch_carb = cum_discount_merch/total_discount_carb)

```

create a boxplot showing the differences in spread in ratios between merchatnable and stand carbon in general

```{r, echo = FALSE}

ratio_boxplot <- portions %>% 
  select(ratio_stand_carb, ratio_merch_carb) %>% 
  gather() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = key, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    y = "Ratio to Total Carbon",
    x = ""
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c('Merchantable Carbon','Stand Carbon'))
ratio_boxplot

```

same plot but just for clear cutting scenarios
NOTE: 32 and 33 are clear cut
31 = grow only
```{r, echo = FALSE}

ratio_boxplot_clearcut <- portions %>% 
  filter(rxpackage == "032" | rxpackage == "033") %>% 
  select(ratio_stand_carb, ratio_merch_carb) %>% 
  gather() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = key, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    y = "Ratio to Total Carbon",
    x = ""
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c('Merchantable Carbon','Stand Carbon'))
ratio_boxplot_clearcut

```

same plot but just for thinning scenarios

```{r, echo = FALSE}

ratio_boxplot_thinning <- portions %>% 
  filter(rxpackage != "032" | rxpackage != "033") %>% 
  select(ratio_stand_carb, ratio_merch_carb) %>% 
  gather() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = key, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    y = "Ratio to Total Carbon",
    x = ""
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c('Merchantable Carbon','Stand Carbon'))
ratio_boxplot_thinning

```

Look at how carbon stored varies across the different eco regions (variants)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
all_data <- read_csv("all_data.csv")

variants <- all_data %>% 
  select(ID, fvs_variant, owngrpcd) %>% 
  group_by(ID, fvs_variant, owngrpcd) %>% 
  summarize()

simple_plus <- simple_acre %>% 
  left_join(variants, by = "ID")

```

Total carbon stored by variant

```{r, echo = FALSE}

variant_carbon <- simple_plus %>% 
  select(biosum_cond_id, ID, rxpackage, fvs_variant, owngrpcd, cpu, 
         total_discount_carb, acres, total_cost) 

variant_boxplot <- variant_carbon %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fvs_variant, y = total_discount_carb)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    x = "FVS Variant",
    y = "Total Discounted Carbon"
  )
variant_boxplot

```

total cpu split by variant

```{r, echo = FALSE}

variant_cost_boxplot <- variant_carbon %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fvs_variant, y = cpu)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    x = "FVS Variant",
    y = "Cost ($) per Ton of Carbon"
  )

variant_cost_boxplot

```

cost per acre split by variant

```{r, echo = FALSE}
variant_cpa <- variant_carbon %>% 
  mutate(cpa = total_cost/acres) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fvs_variant, y = cpa)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    x = "FVS Variant",
    y = "Cost per Acre"
  )
variant_cpa
```

Now let's look at the relationship between cost and elevation 

```{r, echo = FALSE}

plot_loc <- read_csv("plot_loc.csv")

elevation_variants <- plot_loc %>% 
  select(ID, elev) %>% 
  left_join(variant_carbon, by = "ID") %>% 
  filter(biosum_cond_id != "NA") %>% 
  mutate(cpa = total_cost/acres)

ggplot(elevation_variants, aes(x = elev, y = cpa)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = fvs_variant))
  

```

Seems like there's actually not a relationship between elevationa nd cost 


```{r, echo= FALSE}


```


## Allocation of costs
```{r, echo = FALSE}
costs <- opt_tie_break %>% 
  select(ID, acres, rxpackage, discount_harvest, 
         discount_haul_chip, discount_haul_merch, total_discount_carb) %>% 
  mutate(cpa_harvest = discount_harvest/acres) %>% 
  mutate(cpa_haul_chip = discount_haul_chip/acres) %>% 
  mutate(cpa_haul_merch = discount_haul_merch/acres)

costs_spread <- costs %>% 
  select(cpa_harvest, cpa_haul_chip, cpa_haul_merch) %>% 
  gather() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = key, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    y = "Cost per Acre",
    x = "Cost Type"
  )
  
costs_spread
```
